I was able to implement parsing for the following:
* PCAP global packet header
* PCAP packet header
* Ethernet 802.3X header
* IPv4 (w/options), IPv6, VLAN, IPv4-in-IPv4 headers
* UDP, TCP (w/header options)
* DNS packet information

Using tcpdump and wireshark as a reference and consulting the
TCP/IP Illustrated Vol. 1 text, as well as existing code by
Professor Bart Massey, the original author of Wireguppy, I was
able to expand upon Wireguppy by parsing and displaying what I
chose to be relevent and interesting information.

Documentation, source code, and examples by Tim Carstens and
Guy Harris, developers of libpcap and tcpdump were referenced
in constructs and methods. (http://www.tcpdump.org)

Originally, I chose to use structs to read in bytes from stdin
to parse the header fields, but the endianness of individual
fields proved to be frustrating, but the structs and macros
remain.

This program functions as a state machine reading the PCAP file
from stdin and using telltale values from each header, such as
protocol type and length to determine the function call for the
following state.
